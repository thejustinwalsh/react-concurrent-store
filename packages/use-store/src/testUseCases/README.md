# Test Use Cases

This directory contains test files demonstrating how various types of state can be connected to React components using the `useStore` hook.

To validate this experimental API's compatibilty with existing data stores, we will try to collect minimal examples of how representative data stores could leverage this API. This can be done by creating a new file in this directory that either implements a minimal binding API for the actual library, or for a toy implementation of the library.
